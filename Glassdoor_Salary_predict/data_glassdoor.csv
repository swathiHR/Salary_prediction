Job Description

The Knowledgeable AI (KAI) Program at Intel Labs is seeking a motivated senior researcher/developer with a focus on knowledge representation & reasoning and neuro-symbolic AI. This is a full-time position.

While the AI industry is primarily focusing on the efficiency and reach of DL technologies and products entering the market today, it is becoming clear that DL approaches have their limits. The next wave of AI will need to incorporate new innovations to acquire more human-like cognitive competencies and address real-world challenges like explainability, reasoning, out-of-distribution (OOD) data instances, extensibility to new domains with minimal additional data, system adaptation through continuous learning, and other limitations of current DL approaches.

To drive Intel's innovation at the intersection of machine intelligence and cognition, we have established the Knowledgeable AI (KAI) Program for Cognitive Computing Research at Intel Labs. Our efforts combine the latest in deep learning, with the integration of knowledge structures as well as logic-based reasoning and neuro-symbolic AI, in order to build self-learning AI that can make informed decisions in complex context-rich situations.

The ideal candidate will bring proven experience in the AI areas of knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing, computer vision/visual scene parsing, as well as neural networks and deep learning. Research or practice in the sub-fields of neuro-symbolic AI and knowledge graphs is an advantage.

In this position, the candidate will help flesh out the challenging goals of the KAI program and leverage their strong technical knowledge of the field to identify disruptive solutions for the market, collaborate with universities and startups that do cutting edge research and align with our internal research. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the state of the art across multiple fields.

The candidate must also possess strong verbal and written communication skills and a demonstrated ability to work in a team-oriented environment. The candidate is expected to keep up to date with the state-of-the-art in the relevant fields.

Candidates must possess the minimum qualifications below to be initially considered for this position. Preferred qualifications are in addition to the minimum requirements and are considered a plus factor in identifying top candidates.

Qualifications

10-12 years of research/hands-on experience with three or more of the following areas:
Natural language processing
Neuro-symbolic AI
Neural networks and deep learning
Knowledge representation and reasoning
Knowledge graphs
Intelligent systems
10-12 years' experience partnering and collaborating with world-leading technology teams in commercial & academic worlds
10-12 years' experience implementing Proof-of-Concept projects in AI, internally and in collaboration with commercial and academic partners

Preferred qualifications:

Knowledge of python and experience with python libraries for machine learning and deep learning frameworks

Proven track record in innovation and driving new cutting-edge technology initiatives
Experience with hardware optimization for AI acceleration is a plus

91,Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),-1,"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life


We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.
